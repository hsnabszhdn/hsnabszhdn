  summary: |
    With 20 years of working experience, initially started as a full stack developer, worked with ASP classic and vanilla HTML/JS/CSS (in Macromedia Dreamweaver if you remember!).
    Then progressed to .NET 1.1, ASP.NET, jQuery, then to Angular. Witnessed and worked with almost all versions of .NET, C#, and Angular running on bare-metal servers until I switched to cloud native applications.
    Cloud native applications started growing on me, making me a full-time DevOps/Cloud engineer (with all the development experience under my belt).
    I am now a DevOps/cloud engineer, creating and maintaining build/deployment pipelines, cloud infrastructure, as well as bare-metal servers for SSH and VPN access.
